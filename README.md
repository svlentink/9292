# 9292 Pebble app
This repository holds the fundamental basics for a 9292 watch app for the Pebble.

## What is does
It looks at the location of the user and the hour and day of the week to determine where to go.
(e.g. when in the morning on a workday, it knows you want to go to work)

## What to do
Feel free to fork / create pull req.

### Current status
The app currently only displays the first step the user needs to take (e.g. walk to bus stop).
I did not made the effort to create a nice GUI, maybe later, but feel free to create it.
The basics are here, you only need to make a nice layout and icons (for ferry, bus, train, walk etc.).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me (in dutch) if you have questions and or suggestions.
